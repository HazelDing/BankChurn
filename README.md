# Bankchurn Analysis
This project addresses the pressing challenge of credit card customer churn in a banking institution, where a
growing number of customers are discontinuing their credit card services. The objective is to investigate the root causes of
churn and develop a robust churn prediction model using machine learning techniques. The study aims to identify high-risk
customer segments, pinpoint key factors influencing churn, assess the accuracy of the chosen models (Random Forest
Classification and Artificial Neural Network), and propose actionable strategies for retaining high-risk customers. The
anticipated outcome is the development of an accurate churn prediction model that empowers the bank to proactively engage
with customers, enhance services, and minimize customer attrition, ultimately contributing to a substantial reduction in churn
rates and improved overall customer retention.
